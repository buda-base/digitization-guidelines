<h3 id="1a-acquiring-selecting"><strong>(1a) Acquiring - Selecting </strong></h3>
<h3 id="texts">Texts</h3>
<h3 id="analog-text">Analog Text</h3>
<p>There are many kinds of Tibetan writing—<em>most</em> under BDRC’s scope are "analog" (non-digital). While BDRC doesn’t collect stone carvings, they collect just about every other kind of Tibetan writing. This includes various printing techniques, like: hand-written manuscripts, woodblock prints, and modern prints. It includes various papers, like བོད་ཤོག, in various sizes (bound or loose-leaf དཔེ་ཆ, bound books) and various inks, such as མཚལ་པར. </p>
<p>It is important to note that with <em>all</em> these text types, creating multiple copies always changed them. Hand-written manuscripts, of course, contain scribal errors, just as modern-day inputs contain typos. But even woodblocks, after the པར་ཕུད edition, were edited by physically altering the blocks by removing chunks and gluing in the changes. </p>
<p>Modern publications, too, are often edited at the printers, even if the content is a copy of a traditional work. To further complicate matters, modern publications are sometimes unedited reprints, but with different covers and publishing information. Now, even scans of BDRC itself have been reprinted both inside and outside of China. This is one reason knowing the bibliographical information for the text is key. </p>
<p>It’s why the BDRC workflow requires this metadata to be documented. Without accurate bibliographical data, users searching for a text won’t find it; without proper formats and quality for digital data, users who find a text won’t be able to use it. It is for <em>their</em> benefit that BDRC exists; many other digital input and archiving work by many well-meaning people with the right motivation has gone to waste when, years down the line, the data turned out to be un-findable or un-usable. </p>
<p>That’s why <strong>file format, resolution quality, </strong>and<strong> metadata tracking </strong>are all key for properly archiving digital images for the BDRC library.** And it’s nearly the same for etexts... </p>
<h4 id="digital-text">Digital Text</h4>
<p>If we look at the history of etexts, typing systems preceded digital text. Without a moveable type for Tibetan commonly available, the Wylie transliteration system was invented. When desktop computing became more common, Wylie continued as a holdover, in addition to a variety of early Tibetan fonts, in various encodings. </p>
<p>Nowadays, the standard universal encoding for digital text is Unicode. Tibetan has had a full set of encoding in Unicode since version 2.0 (1996). That means, however, that texts in legacy encodings can’t be viewed, nor easily converted. Digital files may also come without metadata, making their provenance unknown. </p>
<p>What edition a digital input of a traditional text is might be unrecorded, or even mixed: For example, an input of the Derge Kangyur that’s edited by referencing the Lhasa Kangyur. Other problems include private collections unwilling to share inputs, leading to huge projects that merely duplicate work, rather than improving already-existing inputs. </p>
<p>Finally, inputs that make use of proprietary software—like Microsoft Word or InDesign or PDF—contain hidden markups that is lost (or cannot be converted) when moving to universal formats. For these reasons and more, <strong>format, encoding, </strong>and<strong> metadata </strong>are also key for etexts.<strong> </strong>These themes of universal access and good metadata are the keys to producing good data; As such, they will be the focus of this manual. </p>
<h3 id="works">Works</h3>
<p>When we say that BDRC is a <strong>digital collection</strong>, what is it a collection <em>of</em>? What are the defined units that make up the collection? Are they texts? Books? Volumes? Collections? Titles? When it comes to defining the primary unit of the collection, we follow the library science standard of collecting "works"—a single publication released at a point in time. </p>
<p>For example, the Derge Kangyur, despite its 103 volumes, more than 1,000 texts, and hundreds of authors, is a single <strong>work</strong>. It was released, as a cohesive whole, at a single point in history. When it is republished at a later point in history, it is yet another <strong>work</strong>. And when pieces of the Derge Kangyur are published independently, as single books, they, too, become <strong>works</strong> in their own right. </p>
<p>While the Kangyur is a "work" containing many texts within many volumes, a “work” may also contain as little as one part of one text—so long as it was published independently. A single text can span multiple works (or multiple volumes within a work); a single volume can span one or more works; or, a work can include multiple authors. </p>
<p>The question for the digital collector is this: When I have "a book" in my hand, is that book a complete work (in and of itself) or merely part of a larger work? How many texts, volumes, and/or titles does it contain (or not contain)? How many authors are represented? These are all important details to document and track in order to ensure the digital collection is <strong>accessible</strong> and <strong>usable</strong> for the users.  </p>
<p>When we’re talking about a collection, we can know if its complete or not by checking the table of contents. It may come right at the beginning, or after the bio of the author. For some large collections, the full last volume <em>is</em> the table of contents. Rather than simply being a list, it’s often written in prose. So it might not be obvious. </p>
<h3 id="titles">Titles</h3>
<p>Titles of works can be a tricky issue. Often, they are simply the name of the text (that occurs on the front cover or the title page). As we described above, however, we need to be careful—is it the title of the <strong>work</strong> at large? Or is it the volume, text, or some other subsection of the work? Is it the long name, the short name, or the nickname? Is the title unique to the work, or does it share the title with another work? If it shares a title, is it a reprint? A new edition? Or another work entirely? Or, is it even untitled? </p>
<p>Traditionally, text name isn’t given at the beginning of a text. If it’s a stand-alone, it will have a cover name; but in a collection, the name won’t come until the end, in the colophon. </p>
<p>Examples: </p>
<p>Naming schemes: ka, kha, ga or a ra pa tsa na di or e wam -- traditional, </p>
<p>modern -- volume numbers </p>
<p>Different people will give different numbers. </p>
<p>PAGES </p>
<p>Usually, one sheet of paper has one number (western to have each side a number). Folio number. But not always consistent. Sometimes a folio gets inserted (8 gong / 8 ‘og) Making page number totals not always straightforward. </p>
<p>Traditional collections each text starts again, but may be marked with a volumer marking (alongside page number). </p>
<p>So table of contents becomes important to check everything is in order and complete. Modern bound books doesn’t matter, numbering comes in order, </p>
<h3 id="authors">Authors</h3>
<p>Authorship, too, is a thorny issue that includes: authors, scribes, translators, editors, proofreaders, or sponsors. Publishers often added this information in lines following the actual text, which means that the Digital Librarian must be careful to select the right name from the many names that may be listed at the end of a work. </p>
<p>Further complicating matters is the fact that many authors, creators, and/or contributors of a text can have many names. While it has become tradition to track identities by first and last name on official documents in the modern world, we have to recognize that this system is not cross-culturally nor cross-historically valid. Buddhist tradition is one of these exceptions. </p>
<p>For example, a child may be given a name by its parents at (or after) birth. Later, they may receive one or more names from one or more Lamas. They may have an ordination name if they become a monastic, a self-ascribed pseudonym if they’re a poet, further names from other Buddhist ceremonies, or an inherited or newly bestowed official title. Any one of these names may then be combined with another, or with a nickname or regional or tribal name...</p>
<p>Just checking the last colophon for an author doesn’t always work; there are usually multiple colophons, often one per publishing, so gotta check it carefully. </p>
<h3 id="classification-numbers-shelving-numbers">Classification numbers / Shelving Numbers</h3>
<p>Once in a library, imp’t to know how it’s organized. Usually it’s by topic or subject of the book. Organized by floors, rooms, or shelves. General way to organize is to use LCC or Dewey Decimal System. To classify knowledge into categories. </p>
<p>LCC uses alphabet, A-Z, ie, A is about general works. B is religion, philosophy, and psychology? (check). Within B, there are subsections for different religions -- Buddhism is BQ for example. Modern libraries usually base on LCC, apply what’s done, adapt to specific collection. For example a library in India might not have some LCC represented, but want to add specificity to books on Hinduism and Buddhism. Then shelves are organized this way. </p>
<p>Reference library / general library. Multiple copies in general, can be borrowed. Reference, only one copy, can’t be borrowed. </p>
<p>Some well-organized Tibetan libraries are like this, but many are not organized like that. The labrang library might be the head priest’s library acting like a reference library. </p>
<p>When a monastery has a shedra, one library for the shedra, books based on the classes that are taught. Kinda like textbooks -- many copies of things connected to class 1, 2, 3 etc., a shelf for each year with connected books. Organized class-wise. General library for other books. </p>
<p>One way is to organize by tradition: Gelug, Nyingma, etc. Another way is to have collections (sungbhums) in one section. Or by publisher. Some by genre/topic / subject, similar to LCC, but when they do, they sometimes split collections to make things fit by topic. Or the collection will be split to be part of the shedra library b/c it’s being used for a class. </p>
<p>They’ll also split sutra / tantra. Specific topics might be at the "same level" as these broad categories. Or they organize by type of book material. All pechas on one side, all books on other. And organize pecha by the size of their pages, not on the content. (Big books, little books, etc.). </p>
<p>Some collections are objects of veneration and are on the altar, or in a shrine room, and these might have very interesting books; other libraries aren’t organized at all, and are just a mess of books. </p>
<p>So while it isn’t standardized, usually there’s a logic to how the collection is organized. So gotta talk to the head about how and why things are organized, and who knows,. </p>

<p>Taxonomy / ontology / </p>
<h3 id="id-numbers">ID numbers</h3>
<p>ISBN, LCCN, BDRC work ID a unique ID given to a specific work published at a specific time (an edition). It identifies a work, but not an exact copy of it. Each copy is given a serial number (for example, a serial number given to an exact book in a library). Some libraries simply append a unique copy number to the shelving number. (ie, the LCCN.01 for the first copy they buy, LCCN.02 for the next, etc.). </p>
<p>The shelving number tells you where to find it on the shelf, and where to put it back. The unique ID is for circulation, so you can track where each book is, who has it. Some libraries have it, some don’t, most Tibetan libraries don’t have this yet. </p>
<p>A BDRC work ID (ie W1PD6786) usually is W followed by a digit and two letters for author PD (ie, 1PD for Paldor), followed by a unique, random number (6786 a "dumb" ID number). In essence, the BDRC (unlike LCCN or ISBN) is a “dumb” number. They are tied to the BDRC metadata. </p>
<p>Shelving numbers (location number), call number, serial numbers, ISBN, LCC (Library of Congress), Dewey Decimal System, "smart" vs. “dumb” numbers, Chinese numbers, BDRC schema</p>
<p>Objects Principle 4: A good object will be named with a persistent, globally unique identifier that can be resolved to the current address of the object.</p>
<p><a href="http://framework.niso.org/21.html">http://framework.niso.org/21.html</a> </p>
<p>Locally unique identifiers should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>scalable, so that many identifiers can be assigned without danger of running out or duplication; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consistent, having a construction that can be easily applied over time; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actionable, or capable of taking one to the object with a single "click" or action; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>persistent, such that the identifier does not change when the location of the object changes. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>METADATA </p>
<p>Metadata is based on Dublin Core. Other ISBD. 15 core identifiers, Dublin Core. Linked data. International standards. </p>
