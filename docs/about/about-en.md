# **BUDA**

**BUDA**—the **B**uddhist **U**niversal **D**igital **A**rchive—is a central bibliographic database for Buddhist texts in a myriad of languages, including Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, and more. Based on linked open data and a digital archive of scanned source texts and searchable eTexts, this database is being created through the collaborative efforts of the: 

1. **Buddhist Resources and Research Center** (at Zhejiang University)

2. **BDRC** (Buddhist Digital Resource Center)

3. **Harvard University Digital Repository**

## **I. Buddhist Resources & Research Center**

The **Buddhist Resources and Research Center** (佛教資源與研究中心) has been established at  **[Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/)** in China to build the **Buddhist Universal Digital Archive (BUDA)**. In particular, the university lends its expertise to the **[Sanskrit and Chinese Buddhist Library Network](https://www.tbrc.org/#!footer/news/20170417)**; Zhejiang also has a strong technology focus in the fields of digital libraries. 

## **II. BDRC**

**[BDRC](https://www.tbrc.org/)** (the Buddhist Digital Resource Center) is the expanded mission of the **Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center**. Founded in 1999 by E. Gene Smith, **BDRC** has preserved and cataloged some 12 million pages of Buddhist literature; its online digital library is especially well-known to the international community of scholars in Tibetan Buddhism. 

## **III. Harvard University Digital Repository Service**

The **[Harvard Library and Harvard Digital Repository Services](http://library.harvard.edu/preservation/digital-preservation)** already provides long-term support to the preservation of **BDRC**’s entire digital collection; soon, this will include the **BUDA** network, too. This will ensure the project’s accessibility for current and future generations despite the ever-shifting technological environment.

The website is presented in 3 languages (**Chinese**, **Tibetan**, and **English**) to allow staff to easily consult equivalent documents. This is especially useful in the case of Tibetan, where technical terms either aren't unified or don't exist. In such cases, staff are able to quickly refer to the English or Chinese.
